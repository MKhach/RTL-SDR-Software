Various useful softwares for the RTL-SDR

To read a brief introduction to the RTL-SDR and the softwares contained in this repository, please refer to the PDF file titled "RTL-SDR: A Brief Introduction"

The folder titled rtl_power Analyzer.zip is my own code.

Note: The folder called Softwares for the RTL-SDR-20180828T042121Z-001.zip contains the softwares kalibrate, Pyrtlsdr, and rtl_power. All credits go to their respectful creators. These were not created by me, I merely compiled their Windows compatible versions  in one place for convencience, and updated some code for Python 3. The Linux compatible versions are easily found by searching for the names of the softwares on GitHub. The program in the folder titled "rtl_power Analyzer.zip" was created by me.
