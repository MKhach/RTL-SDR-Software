# RTL-SDR-Software
Various useful softwares for the RTL-SDR
Note: The folder called Softwares for the RTL-SDR-20180828T042121Z-001.zip contains the softwares kalibrate, Pyrtlsdr, and rtl_power. These were not created by me, I merely compiled their Windows compatible versions, and updated some code for Python 3 in one place. The Linux compatible versions are easily found by searching for the names of the softwares on GitHub.
